# CancerPrediction
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that can learn and predict whether the breast cancer tumours would become malignant through a large dataset provided (https://www.kaggle.com/code/jagannathrk/predicting-breast-cancer-logistic-regression/data). The dataset comprises various observable parameters of the breast cancer tumours, such as the radius, smoothness, concavity of the tumours and others. The logistic regression, a machine learning model that can be applied to predict a classifcation problem has been selected for this case. 

In order to speed up the training process, the correlation between the parameters have been examined via pair plot and correlation table as shown follows.
